            Danae discusses the different types of web art and in a sense, how they have evolved in, <br></br>
            <u>“Net Art, Post-internet Art, New Aesthetics: The Fundamentals of Art on the Internet.”</u> <br></br>
            Net art is network art, rather than internet art, which Danae describes as art that had been produced during the “Web 1.0” era. (Danae, 2019:1) <br></br>
            This specific era had no user interface and used static web pages, this had created the building blocks to the evolution of web/net art. <br></br> 
            Post-internet art can be seen as net art that had been evolved from Net art, the difference being that this would then be created through “Web 2.0”. <br></br>
            Danae mentions that users could share information in real-time, also known as the dynamic interfaces. (Danae, 2019:3) <br></br>
            New Aesthetics can be seen as the current form of Net Art, due to the fact that it combines both physical and virtual artworks, <br></br>
            this will allow the reproduction of different artworks and allow people to experience these works easily.<br></br> 
            <br></br>
            David Carrier makes use of <u>“The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1936)</u>, <br></br>
            by Walter Benjamin, as a framework for his “The Work of Art in the Age of the Internet”. <br></br>
            David Carrier discusses how art has changed and become digitised, much like how Benjamin discusses art reproduction. (Carrier, 2020:1).<br></br>
            When art is reproduced or displayed in different ways, it’s meaning can change, as well as the audience’s perspective on these specific artworks. <br></br>
            As Benjamin was saying, Aura is lost when art is reproduced. So internet artists will rather work for the sake of the internet, <br></br>
            rather than the aura and originality of creating an artwork. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Looking at the Rhizome Artbase website, it is evident that there are artworks that span over the past few decades. <br></br> 
            Each of these artworks are made during certain eras of Net Art, therefore they portray the evolution of Net Art.<br></br> 
            Danae’s discussion can aid in analysing the different artworks through the ages.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            In 1995, Heath Bunting created <u>“Untitled (Splash Page)”</u>, which is a basic, low resolution illustration that is in black and white. <br></br>
            This can easily be categorised as Net Art that had been created through Web 1.0 with its static pages and no user interface. <br></br>
            As we view the artwork now, it seems basic and unspecial, but it was one of the first few artworks created in the age of the internet. <br></br>
            Therefore, it can be seen as the building blocks for Net Art and our Post-internet Art.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            In 2006, Roch Forowicz created “Environment”, an artwork that allows members of that specific project to <br></br> communicate with each other through phone, email or video. 
            This marked the beginning of artworks being created in Web 2.0 with its user interface  <br></br> and dynamic pages. This can be categorised as Post-internet art,
            due to the fact that there are dynamic pages, as well as the two way communication, as opposed to Web 1.0’s one way communication. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            In 2012, Porpentine created “Howling Dogs”, a hypertext game that puts the player in an enclosed area that they have to escape.  <br></br>
            This is an example of New Aesthetics, due to the fact that it combines physical and virtual artworks.  <br></br>
            In this case, the hypertext game can be viewed as an internet artwork, as well as a game. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Using the works of Danae and Carrier to analyse the Rhizome Artbase, it can be seen that Net Art has <br></br> evolved drastically from just being Net Art to New Aesthetics. <br></br>
            With this evolution, artworks have been used as references to create new artworks,<br></br> therefore the original artworks are not losing their value, 
            but rather inspiring people to create more net artworks. <br></br>
            These artists are creating art with their own personalised aura, while taking references and ideas from previous net artists. <br></br>
