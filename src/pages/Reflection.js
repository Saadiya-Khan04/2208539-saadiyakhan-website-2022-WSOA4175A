            I did not have a lot of problems, in terms of coding. Although, there are many things that I would have liked to add to my site. <br></br>
            I am having a bit of a hard time trying to grasp the concept of using props and state. I didn’t need to use it in my site for this assignment, <br></br>
            as my navbar is very simple, and my site is very basic. Andre’s lectures really do help a lot, although I am a bit slow. <br></br>

            I don’t know what I want to add to my website yet, as net/web art. My original idea was that I display some of my original artworks there, <br></br> 
            as well as talk about games. It would have been a personal blog, and after each game is discussed, I would draw something that closely resembles <br></br>
            a character or item from the game. Although, I saw that our sites cannot be holding places for artworks, so I am a bit lost.<br></br>

            I decided to just stick to the requirements for this assignment, and add in as much as I can. <br></br> I did try to focus on the theoretical aspects of this assignment, 
            but they were even more challenging. <br></br>

            Personally, I do quite like the colours and fonts of my site at the moment because it is a different type of scheme that I wanted to try, <br></br>
            in comparison to my regular styling. <br></br> The layout will be fixed eventually, where images are displayed cleanly, as well as boxes for the blog posts that have
            a slight animation effect.<br></br>

            I do struggle with coding, as a whole, but I am excited to create different things. <br></br>
            <br></br>

            The readings in this quarter were either interesting or very challenging. I genuinely did enjoy reading about Functionality VS Aesthetics, <br></br>
            as a web developer it is always interesting to understand why things should be a certain way.<br></br>
            Although the Park reading did thoroughly confuse me, I did try to understand the basics of it. <br></br>

            The topic of Week 7, the internet, society and design injustice is a bit tricky. There are a lot of concepts to keep in mind, <br></br>
            and to take into consideration when it comes to issues such as the ones that are described.<br></br>

            I did enjoy taking a look at the Rhizome Artbase, it was really interesting to look at internet art through the ages.<br></br> It was slightly challenging in trying to 
            critically analyse and discuss it, looking through multiple different artworks and <br></br>
            trying to deduce if they had been referenced before or have made reference to existing artworks. <br></br>
